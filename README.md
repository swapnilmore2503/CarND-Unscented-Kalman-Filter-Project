# Unscented Kalman Filter
This Project is the seventh task (Project 2 of Term 2) of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program. The main goal of the project is to apply Unscented Kalman Filter to fuse data from LIDAR and Radar sensors of a self driving car using C++.

The project was created with the Udacity [Starter Code](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Unscented-Kalman-Filter-Project).

---

## Content of this repo
- `scr`  a directory with the project code:
- `main.cpp` - reads in data, calls a function to run the Kalman filter, calls a function to calculate RMSE
- `ukf.cpp` - the UKF filter itself, defines the predict function, the update function for lidar, and the update function for radar
- `tools.cpp` - a function to calculate RMSE
- `data`  a directory with two input files, provided by Udacity
- `results`  a directory with output files

## Results
1. Input file: *sample-laser-radar-measurement-data-1.txt*
![input 1 results](readme_img/plot1.png)

RMSE = [0.0758215, 0.0842188, 0.632344, 0.580668]

Threshold: RMSE <= [0.09, 0.09, 0.65, 0.65]

2. Input file: *sample-laser-radar-measurement-data-2.txt*
![input 2 results](readme_img/plot2.png)

RMSE = [0.194559 0.189894 0.518945 0.507547]

Threshold: RMSE <= [0.20, 0.20, 0.55, 0.55]
